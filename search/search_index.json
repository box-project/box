However unlike in a  compiled language, the code does not change. This, when the PHAR loads external code, can lead to dependency conflicts.</p> <p>To illustrate that issue with an example: we are building a console application <code>myapp.phar</code> which relies on the library Symfony YAML 2.8.0 which execute a given PHP script.</p> <pre><code># Usage of the application we are building\nmyapp.phar myscript.php\n</code></pre> <p>For the sake of the example, <code>myapp.phar</code> is using Composer and loads the YAML component right away when starting, i.e. when running <code>myapp.phar</code>, the class <code>Symfony\\Yaml\\Yaml</code> from the PHAR is going to be loaded. Now what <code>myapp.phar</code> is actually going to do is scan the whole file given, and do some reflection work on each classes found. I.e. for each class <code>$class</code> found, it will do <code>new \\ReflectionClass($class)</code>. </p> <p>Now if <code>myscript.php</code> is using the Symfony YAML 4.0.0 component with some new features added in 4.0.0 that are non-existent in 2.8.0, when doing <code>new \\ReflectionClass('Symfony\\Yaml\\Yaml')</code>, the class <code>Symfony\\Yaml\\Yaml</code> will be loaded (yes, doing reflection on a class loads it!). BUT, it turns out the class <code>Symfony\\Yaml\\Yaml</code> is already loaded: not the 4.0.0 from <code>myscript.php</code> but the one from the PHAR (<code>2.8.0</code>). So any information you will get will be from the wrong class!</p> <p>Is this really an issue? The answer is it depends. Here as a few real life example where this is an issue:</p> <ul> <li>A static analysis tool like PHPStan</li> <li>A test framework like PHPUnit</li> <li>A quality analysis tool like SensioLabsInsight which executes arbitrary code (e.g. to check)   that the application is booting</li> <li>A piece of code that can be mixed with any code, such as a Wordpress plugin</li> </ul>"},{"location":"code-isolation/#isolating-the-phar","title":"Isolating the PHAR","text":"<p>Box provides an integration with PHP-Scoper.
