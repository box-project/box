# Symfony support

What makes Symfony a bit special for shipping it into a PHAR is its compilation step. Indeed the Symfony container can
be dumped depending on multiple parameters such the application environment, whether it is in debug mode or not and if
the cache is fresh.

A PHAR however is a readonly only environment, which means the container _cannot_ be dumped once inside the PHAR. To
prevent the issue, you need to make sure of the following:

- The cache is warmed up before being shipped within the PHAR
- The application within the PHAR is running in production mode

To achieve this with the least amount of changes is to:

- Create the `.env.local.php` file by running the following command:

```
$ composer dump-env prod
```

This will ensure when loading the variables that your application is in production mode.

- Change the following part of the `composer.json` file:

```json
"scripts": {
    "auto-scripts": {
        "cache:clear": "symfony-cmd",
        "assets:install %PUBLIC_DIR%": "symfony-cmd"
    },
    "post-install-cmd": [
        "@auto-scripts"
    ],
    "post-update-cmd": [
        "@auto-scripts"
    ]
},
```

For:

```json
"scripts": {
    "auto-scripts": {
        "cache:clear": "symfony-cmd"
    },
    "post-autoload-dump": [
        "@auto-scripts"
    ]
},
```

I.e.:

- You skip the installation of assets (which you shouldn't need in the context of a CLI application)
- Trigger the auto-scripts, which includes the cache warming phase, on the Composer dump-autoload event

This last part takes advantage of Box [dumping the autoloader][composer-autoloader-dump] by default.
